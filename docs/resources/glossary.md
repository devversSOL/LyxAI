## Glossary

This glossary defines common terms used in the documentation.

**Account:** An entity that can send and receive transactions on a blockchain. Accounts have an address and a balance.

**Address:** A unique identifier for an account on a blockchain.

**Block:** A collection of transactions that are grouped together, cryptographically secured, and added to a blockchain.

**Blockchain:** A distributed, immutable ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent manner.

**Consensus Mechanism:** The method by which a distributed network of computers agrees on the validity of transactions and the state of the blockchain.

**Cryptography:** The art and science of secret writing. Cryptography is used to secure transactions and data on a blockchain.

**Decentralized Application (dApp):** An application that runs on a decentralized network, such as a blockchain.

**Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO):** An organization that is governed by rules encoded in a smart contract and executed automatically.

**Gas:** A unit of measurement for the computational effort required to execute a transaction on a blockchain.

**Hash:** A cryptographic function that takes an input and produces a unique, fixed-size output.

**Immutability:** The property of a blockchain that ensures that once data is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted.

**Key Pair:** A set of two related cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The public key can be shared, while the private key must be kept secret.

**Metadata:** Data that provides information about other data.

**Node:** A computer that participates in a blockchain network.

**Nonce:** A number used only once in a cryptographic communication.

**Private Key:** A secret key that is used to sign transactions and control access to an account.

**Public Key:** A key that can be shared with others and is used to verify signatures.

**Smart Contract:** A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Smart contracts are stored on a blockchain and automatically executed when the specified conditions are met.

**Transaction:** An action that changes the state of a blockchain. Transactions are typically used to transfer value or data between accounts.

**Wallet:** A software application or hardware device that allows users to store, manage, and transact with their digital assets.
