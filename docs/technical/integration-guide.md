# Technical Integration Guide

This guide provides instructions for integrating with our platform.

## Getting Started

To begin, you'll need to obtain an API key. You can request one by contacting our support team at support@example.com.

Once you have your API key, you can start making requests to our API.

## Authentication

All API requests must be authenticated using your API key. You can include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header of your requests.

Example:

\`\`\`
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.example.com/data
\`\`\`

## Data Retrieval

You can retrieve data from our platform using the following endpoints:

### Get User Data

This endpoint allows you to retrieve user data by user ID.

Endpoint: `GET /users/{user_id}`

Example:

\`\`\`
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.example.com/users/123
\`\`\`

Response:

\`\`\`json
{
  "user_id": 123,
  "username": "johndoe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
\`\`\`

### Get Product Data

This endpoint allows you to retrieve product data by product ID.

Endpoint: `GET /products/{product_id}`

Example:

\`\`\`
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.example.com/products/456
\`\`\`

Response:

\`\`\`json
{
  "product_id": 456,
  "product_name": "Example Product",
  "price": 99.99
}
\`\`\`

## Error Handling

Our API returns standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request.

*   `200 OK`: The request was successful.
*   `400 Bad Request`: The request was invalid.
*   `401 Unauthorized`: The API key is missing or invalid.
*   `404 Not Found`: The requested resource was not found.
*   `500 Internal Server Error`: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

## Rate Limiting

Our API is rate limited to prevent abuse. You are allowed 100 requests per minute. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error.
